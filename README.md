## 🎯 How It Works

### Step 1: Symptom Input
Users describe their health concerns through an intuitive interface

### Step 2: AI Analysis
The system analyzes symptoms and classifies them into severity levels:

1. **Mild Issues**: Provides immediate AI-driven medical and dietary advice
2. **Moderate Issues**: Recommends nearby doctors with ratings and booking options
3. **Severe Issues**: Suggests nearest hospitals and emergency ambulance services

### Step 3: Action & Follow-up
Users receive actionable recommendations and can immediately access suggested services
